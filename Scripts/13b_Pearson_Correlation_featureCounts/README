#README file for the pearson correlation analysis for sample replicates.
#This is a new module in the RNAseq pipeline to assure the quality of the sample replicates by calculating the Pearson correlation values within each sample. 
#The quality can be tested at two levels:  
# a) By calculating the Pearson values for all the genes 
# b) By filtering out genes based on the mean RPKM (>1)  and calculate the correlation.

The way this work in the pipeline is as follows :

1) There is are two additional folders added in the pipeline : 

 13a_Pearson_Correlation_HTSeq 
 13b_Pearson_Correlation_featureCounts.

2) Inside each of the two folders you will find the Pearson_script.R - That calculates the Pearson correlation values for all the replicates  and also generate a heatmap for easy visualization

How does the output looks likes?

- The output of this analysis would be two folders : 
a)Pearson_All , b)Pearson_Filtered

Inside each of these two folders, the user will find two file formats - 
a) .csv (Pearson values in tabular format), b) .pdf (Heatmap). 
The user can see these two files generated for every differential expression comparison.
Additionally, there is a merge.csv and merge.pdf file which includes Pearson comparison for every sample in the dataset.

How can one run this analysis ?

There are two ways of running it : Locally or  as part of the complete pipeline

a) As part of the pipeline : You can run this step by calling the name of this step or it will be implemented automatically if the user runs the complete pipeline
for example: 

./03_Run_Pipeline.sh 13a_Pearson_Correlation_HTSeq

 
b) Locally: Alternatively, one can go into the step folder and run the ./Run_Jobs.sh script.  However one needs to ensure that they have the files from differential expression analysis.

Hope this new module will help you ensure the quality control of your samples replicates in less cumbersome manner.
